<!-- doctypes 'document type'
	help browsers to understand the version of html the document is written in

	Doctype declarations are not HTML tags and belong at the very top of a doc

	The <!DOCTYPE> declaration should always be included at the top of the
	HTML document, before the <html> tag.
-->

<!Doctype html>

<!-- the string Doctype is an ASCII case-insesitive

	therefore the following DOCTYPEs are also valid:

<!doctype html>
<!dOCtyPe html>
<!DocTYpe html>

-->

<!dOCtyPe html>
