<a href="http://example.com/">Link</a>

<!-- If you gave an id attribute to your topics, you could then link to them -->
<h2 id="Topic1">First topic</h2>
<p>Content about the first topic</p>
<h2 id="Topic2">Second topic</h2>
<p>Content about the second topic</p>
<!-- Now you can use the anchor in your table of contents: -->
<h1>Table of Contents</h1>
<a href='#Topic1'>Click to jump to the First Topic</a>
<a href='#Topic2'>Click to jump to the Second Topic</a>

<!-- Open link in new tab/window-->
<a href="example.com" target="_blank">Text Here</a>

<!--
SECURITY VULNERABILITY WARNING!
Using target="_blank" gives the opening site partial access to the window.opener object via JavaScript,
which allows that page to then access and change the window.opener.location of your page and
potentially redirect users to malware or phishing sites.
Whenever using this for pages you do not control, add rel="noopener" to your link to prevent the
window.opener object from being sent with the request.
Currently, Firefox does not support noopener, so you will need to use rel="noopener noreferrer" for
maximum eï¬€ect.
