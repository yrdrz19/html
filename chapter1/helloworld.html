<!-- HTML(Hypertext Markup Language)
	With HTML you declare what is presented to a viewer, not how is presented.
	Visual representations are defined by Cascading Style Sheets(CSS).

	HTML is a markup language not a programming language cause it has no logic.

	An element usually consists of an opening tag (<element_name>),
	a closing tag (</element_name>), which contain the
	element's name surrounded by angle brackets, and the content in between:
	<element_name>...content...</element_name>

	There are some HTML elements that don't have a closing tag or any contents.
	These are called void elements. Void elements include <img>, <meta>,
	<link> and <input>.

	It is important to note the difference between elements and tags:
	Elements: video, audio, table, footer
	Tags: <video>, <audio>, <table>, <footer>, </html>, </body>
