<!-- Correct structure matters
Search engines and other user agents usually index page content based on
heading elements, for example to create a table of contents, so using the
correct structure for headings is important.
In general, an article should have one h1 element for the main title followed
by h2 subtitles â€“ going down a layer if necessary. If there are h1 elements
on a higher level they shoudn't be used to describe any lower level content.
